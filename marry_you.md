## Marriage in the Ukraine

	required documents for me (Marcel):
	- passport, verified by ukranian notar/lawyer

	required documents for her (Karina):
	- native passport

### Stage 1 - Get married in the Ukraine

	[ ] get married in some city to get the marriage-documents.
	[ ] let the documents get verified in the Ukraine (takes ~1 week).
	[ ] let the documents get verified by a German dolmetcher (ISO 9:1995)

	--- now the documents are valid in Germany... time to get your D-VISA

#### Stage 2 - Request for a "D-VISA" in Kiew

	I order to get a valid D-VISA for you, we need some documents and
	tasks to be done before and after...

	[ ] have the documents from "Stage 1"
	[ ] you need to pass a "language-test" for german language:
		( ) you need to proof that you can understand basic language, if spoken slowly.
		( ) you need to know simple basic words of allday usage. (like "Frau, Mann und Kind")
		( ) you need to know how to say "Who You Are", "Where you live" and do the same for
			  another person. Like "This is Marcel and he lives in ... is XX years old... etc."
		    -THATS IT-
	[x] neeed a copy of my german passport.
	[ ] 2 passport pictures, one for you, one for me
	[ ] 2 VISA-requests filled with our details.
	[x] passport needs to be valid for at least 3 months.
	[ ] an invitation for you to germany, written by me to the embassy.

	You have to be personally(!) at the germany Embassy in Kiew, Bohdana Chmelnitzkoho 25
	and make your request for D-VISA. They will interview you and you have to make
	a date in the forehand with them to do this.

	I have to be interviewed personally(!) at the German foreigner-registry. This is required,
	before you make your interview in Kiew.

	Now you will get a D-VISA for 3 months (just temporary), then you come to Germany
	with this VISA and we go to the foreigner-registry.

	( 10% of requests for permanent VISA get declined somehow, I dont know... )

	Now we are done and married for really really really long time i hope ;-).

	I love you babe
